# 🜏 ARKHE(N): Thermodynamic Multi-Agent Operating System

**ARKHE(N)** is a unified framework for information thermodynamics, multi-agent synergy, and multiversal exploration. It provides a declarative meta-language (ANL) and a high-performance operating system kernel (Omni-Kernel) designed for the next generation of autonomous and interoperable AI systems.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

The system is built on the fundamental principle of **$C + F = 1$** (Conservation of Coherence and Fluctuation) and the identity **$x^2 = x + 1$**.

### 1. Arkhe(n) Language (ANL)
A declarative meta-language for modeling any system as a hypergraph of **Nodes** and **Handovers**.
- **Specification**: `docs/ARKHE_N_LANGUAGE_ANL.md`
- **Compiler/Prototype**: `metalanguage/anl_compiler.py` (Version 0.6)
- **Rosetta Stone**: Implementation snippets in 17+ languages in `metalanguage/rosetta/`.

### 2. Arkhe(N) Omni-Kernel
The heartbeat of the system, supporting:
- **Asynchronous Interactions**: Non-blocking handovers via shared latent memory.
- **Thermodynamic Safety**: Real-time KL-divergence monitoring and entropy vetoes.
- **Integrated Information (Φ)**: Measure of system-wide cognitive emergence.
- **Kernel Implementation**: `arkhe_omni_kernel.py`

### 3. Safety & Oversight
Robust mechanisms to prevent and detect multi-agent collusion and alignment failure.
- **Reformed Detector Hierarchy**: 4 levels of anomaly detection in `metalanguage/detectors_v2.py`.
- **Steganography Monitoring**: Tracking "thermodynamic bleeding" in covert channels.
