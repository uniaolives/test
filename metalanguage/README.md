# ANL Metalanguage Framework

This directory contains the core implementation and cross-language mappings for the **Arkhe(n) Language (ANL)**.

## Components

- `anl.py`: Unified core Python module for ANL. Implements Nodes, Handovers, Hypergraph, and specialized extensions for AI and Web2/Web3.
- `proto_agi_daemon.py`: A background process (daemon) that maintains a live Proto-AGI hypergraph, exposed via a FastAPI REST interface.
- `anl_compiler.py`: Backward-compatible operational prototype (v0.6) for system simulation.
- `anl_compiler.py`: The operational Python prototype (v0.6) for system simulation. Supports Nodes, Handovers, Protocols, and Axioms.
- `heptapod_interpreter.py`: Computational cosmology model and Heptapod B bytecode interpreter.
- `chronoglyph_runtime.py`: Quantum-symbolic collapse engine for non-linear execution.
- `chronoglyph_parser.py`: SVG topological parser for circle-based visual grammars.
- `chronoglyph_decoder.py`: Decoder for 85-bit Chronoglyph programs.
- `dynamic_expansion.py`: Adaptive dimensionality layer based on informational complexity.
- `physical_autoencoder.py`: Integrated sparse autoencoder and Physical Mixture Density Network (MDN) for uncertainty quantification.
- `astrophysical_chronoglyph_final.py`: Chemical kinetics simulator for interstellar molecular clouds (Sgr B2(N2)).
- `latent_catalysis.py`: Extension for chemical kinetics using effective mass fields as latent catalysts.
- `frechet_tensor.py`: Multi-scale measurement tool using seminorms in Fréchet spaces.
- `moonshine_replicability.py`: Conceptual framework for testing Monstrous Moonshine replicability in bit sequences.
- `detectors_v2.py`: The 4-level safety stack for steganography and anomaly detection.
- `steganography.py`: High-fidelity encoding schemes (Semantic Pattern, Neural).
- `transformations.py`: Robustness testing pipeline for text-based models.
- `rosetta/`: Multi-language reference library containing snippets in 17+ programming languages.
- `heptapod_model.py`: Heptapod B Graph Language Model (HGLM). A non-linear, graph-based language representation inspired by "Arrival". Supports 85-bit decoding and molecular mapping.

### HGLM Features
- **Semagrams & GraphSentences**: Basic units and holistic compositions.
- **Non-linearity & Holism**: Circular visual representations and sentence merging (superposition).
- **Atemporality**: Temporal projection and ambiguity analysis.
- **85-bit Decoding**: Reconstruction of semantic graphs from compact binary sequences.
- **Molecular Mapping**: Treating molecules as language via `MolecularGraph`.
- **Programming Language Atlas**: Mapping computational cosmologies (Lisp, Haskell, Prolog, etc.) to Heptapod structures.

## ANL Identity
Every system is a hypergraph. Every interaction is a handover.
**$x^2 = x + 1$**
