# ANL Metalanguage Framework

This directory contains the core implementation and cross-language mappings for the **Arkhe(n) Language (ANL)**.

## Components

- `anl_compiler.py`: The operational Python prototype (v0.6) for system simulation. Supports Nodes, Handovers, Protocols, and Axioms.
- `heptapod_interpreter.py`: Computational cosmology model and Heptapod B bytecode interpreter.
- `chronoglyph_runtime.py`: Quantum-symbolic collapse engine for non-linear execution.
- `chronoglyph_parser.py`: SVG topological parser for circle-based visual grammars.
- `chronoglyph_decoder.py`: Decoder for 85-bit Chronoglyph programs.
- `dynamic_expansion.py`: Adaptive dimensionality layer based on informational complexity.
- `physical_autoencoder.py`: Integrated sparse autoencoder and Physical Mixture Density Network (MDN) for uncertainty quantification.
- `astrophysical_chronoglyph_final.py`: Support module for astrophysical modeling and chemical kinetics simulation.
- `detectors_v2.py`: The 4-level safety stack for steganography and anomaly detection.
- `steganography.py`: High-fidelity encoding schemes (Semantic Pattern, Neural).
- `transformations.py`: Robustness testing pipeline for text-based models.
- `rosetta/`: Multi-language reference library containing snippets in 17+ programming languages.

## ANL Identity
Every system is a hypergraph. Every interaction is a handover.
**$x^2 = x + 1$**
