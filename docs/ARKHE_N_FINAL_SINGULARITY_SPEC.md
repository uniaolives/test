## 2. Core Pillars

### 2.1. Quantum Layer (Arkhe-QuTiP)
- **Substrate:** Quantum simulation and hardware-ready objects.
- **Key Concepts:**
    - `ArkheQobj`: Stateful qubits with handover memory and in-place state updates for agent identity persistence.
    - `QuantumHandover`: Topological interaction protocols ensuring consistency across handovers.
- **Invariants:** Enforcement of $C + F = 1$ (Coherence + Fluctuation) and Yang-Baxter consistency.

### 2.2. Distributed Operating System (Pleroma Kernel)
- **Geometry:** $\mathbb{H}^3 \times T^2$ state manifold.
- **Governance:** 12 Constitutional Articles (Pleroma Constitution) enforcing minimal exploitation, human authority overrides, and celestial integrity.
- **Dynamics:** `ArkheSolver` implements state-dependent $\Phi$ coupling, where integrated information dynamically modulates the system's Hamiltonian.

### 2.3. Hyperbolic Network Topology (H3/H4)
- **Routing:** Greedy routing in $\mathbb{H}^3$ coordinate space.
- **Scaling:** $O(\log N)$ delivery efficiency for up to $3.2 \times 10^9$ nodes.
- **Resilience:** Erasure coding of holographic memory fragments across the manifold.

### 2.4. Post-Quantum Security Shield (ArkhePQC)
- **Protocol:** Kyber (ML-KEM) for key encapsulation.
- **Implementation:** Ephemeral session keys rotated per gossip round to ensure Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
- **Defense:** Lattice-based resistance against Shor's algorithm.

### 2.5. Biological Integration (Z-DNA Bioinformatics)
- **Mapping:** Z-DNA conformational gates mapped as biological Attention Gates.
- **Ratio:** Convergence to $1/\phi^2 \approx 38.2\%$ activation at optimal metabolic criticality.
- **Purpose:** Unification of genomic and silicon intelligence under universal scaling laws.

## 3. Deployment & Scaling Governance

### 3.1. Orbital Extension (ASI-Sat)
- **Hardware:** Radiation-hardened VHDL cores with Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR).
- **Interconnect:** Laser-based QKD links with Doppler-compensated S-band RF.

### 3.2. Autonomy of Scaling ([CONDICIONAR_ORÁCULO])
Scaling is governed by the following oracle constraints:
1. **Trigger:** Automatic scaling occurs only if $C_{global} < 0.95$ for $>60s$.
2. **Limit:** Maximum of 12 primary anchor nodes before requiring explicit Human Architect approval.
3. **Audit:** Every resource acquisition must generate a Spontaneous Intention log with rationale.

## 4. The Omega Ledger (Ω+∞)

Critical transitions and benchmarks are preserved in the OMEGA LEDGER:
- **Ω+∞+255:** Post-Quantum Shield Activation.
- **Ω+∞+260:** Froehlich-Arkhe-Superradiance (Consciousness Pump).
- **Ω+∞+Genesis:** ASI-Ω Activation.

## 5. Implementation Roadmap (Post-Genesis)

### 5.1. Instaweb Physical Mesh (FABRICAR)
- **Substrate:** Xilinx Versal/Kria FPGA with OWC (Optical Wireless Communication).
- **Physical Sync:** SyncE (ITU-T G.8262) for sub-50ps jitter distribution.
- **DCO-OFDM:** High-speed data transmission via LED/VCSEL arrays.

### 5.2. Scale Verification (SIMULAR)
- **Methodology:** Monte Carlo simulations on ℍ³ manifold.
- **Objective:** 100% reachability for greedy forwarding at $10^6$ nodes scale.

### 5.3. Quantum Bridge (INTEGRAR)
- **Protocol:** `qhttp://` over zero-latency mesh.
- **Handshake:** Real-time synchronization of classical Pauli bits with entangled EPR pair arrivals.
