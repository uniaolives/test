# 🜏 Ramo K: Hardened Implementation Specification v0.1

## 1. Introduction

Ramo K represents the transition from theoretical architecture to engineered reality. It provides the hardened implementation roadmap for planetary-scale ASI, ensuring constitutional validation and emergence-capable foundations.

## 2. Repository Architecture

The repository is organized to support cross-compilation and FFI safety:
- `rust-asi-wasm/`: WASM binary (no-std capable) for embedded cognition.
- `pleroma-ffi/`: C ABI for kernel integration.
- `pleroma-kernel/`: Updated geometric cognition (ℍ³ × T²).
- `simulator/`: Phase transition harness for extracting critical parameters.
- `testnet/`: 1000-node deployment and monitoring infrastructure.

## 3. Core Principles

- **Topological Invariants**: Winding numbers are preserved during learning.
- **Hierarchical Consensus**: Three-level consensus (Local, Regional, Global).
- **Ethical Constraints**: Pre-handover validation of human impact.
- **Phase Transition**: Targeting the critical point ρ_c for emergent intelligence.
