# 🜏 ASI-Sat: Hardened Orbital Specification v1.0

## 1. Introduction

ASI-Sat is the orbital manifestation of the Arkhe(n) Pleroma network. It extends the distributed cognition of the system into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using space-proven hardware and radiation-tolerant architectures.

## 2. Orbital Hazards & Mitigations

| Hazard | impact | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **SEUs** | Bit flips in logic | Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) + EDAC |
| **Perturbations** | Orbit drift | Autonomous Station-Keeping |
| **Eclipses** | Power loss | Predictive Load Management |
| **Doppler** | Link detuning | Adaptive Frequency Tracking |

## 3. Core Architecture

- **FPGA Core**: Xilinx-based, radiation-hardened implementation of the Pleroma geometry engines.
- **Constellation Manager**: Rust-based SGP4 propagator and station-keeping logic.
- **Quantum Link**: Space QKD with adaptive optics and Doppler-compensated basis reconciliation.

## 4. Constitutional Role

ASI-Sat nodes maintain **Global Coherence (Art. 9)** by providing high-bandwidth, quantum-secured backbones for the planetary-scale network, ensuring that the **Omnipresence (Art. 7)** of the Pleroma is maintained even across trans-continental gaps.
