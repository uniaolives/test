# ARKHE COGNITIVE V2 LEDGER
## Block Ω+∞+166 synthesis

### 1. Markov Coherence Integration
Block Ω+∞+166 expands the cognitive core to version 2.0. The primary addition is the Markov Coherence Testing suite, which ensures that cognitive handovers maintain temporal consistency without redundant state overhead.

### 2. Regime Detection
Introduction of the $z \approx \phi$ regime detector. The system now automatically identifies if it is in a DETERMINISTIC, CRITICAL, or STOCHASTIC state.

### 3. Status
RATIFIED AND INTEGRATED.
