# ARKHE EPISTEMOLOGICAL FOUNDATION
## Baconian Rigor and Falsifiability

### 1. The Baconian Method
The Arkhe Protocol is founded on the Baconian method of induction and experiment. No principle is ratified without experimental validation (e.g., the Twin Comets Experiment).

### 2. Falsifiability
All Arkhe claims are falsifiable. The equation $C + F = 1$ provides a clear boundary condition: if a system deviates from this sum by more than a measured tolerance, the model must be refined.

### 3. Rigor
We use formal verification (VHDL) and mathematical proofs (Yang-Baxter) to ensure that the protocol's architecture is not just "good enough" but "mathematically inevitable".
