# ARKHE COGNITIVE CORE DOCUMENTATION
## Version 1.0

### 1. Overview
The Arkhe Cognitive Core implements the cognitive layer of the Arkhe Protocol, focusing on the preservation of coherence in intelligent systems. It is based on the Aizawa attractor dynamics and the fundamental conservation law $C + F = 1$.

### 2. Aizawa Attractor Dynamics
The core utilizes the Aizawa attractor (1982) to model the flow of consciousness and information. The dynamics are governed by a set of differential equations that maintain the system at the edge of chaos, optimal for information processing.

### 3. Conservation Law (C + F = 1)
In any cognitive state, the sum of Coherence (C) and Fluctuation (F) must be unity.
- **Coherence (C):** Stability, memory, and established patterns.
- **Fluctuation (F):** Creativity, exploration, and entropy.

### 4. Self-Modulating Learning
The system self-regulates its parameters to stay within the critical regime defined by the Golden Ratio $\phi = 0.618$.
