# ARKHE PROTOCOL EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
## The Future of Orbital Information Physics

### 1. Market Opportunity
The LEO satellite market is projected to reach $35B by 2030. Arkhe Protocol provides the only post-quantum, topological-immune communication layer for this ecosystem.

### 2. Strategic Advantage
- **Post-Quantum:** Hardware-accelerated Ring-LWE zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Resilient:** Yang-Baxter invariants ensure path-independent data integrity.
- **Efficient:** 285mW power consumption on RTG4 FPGA.

### 3. Investment Call
We are seeking partners for the Phase D (Launch) of the Arkhe-1 mission. Join us as we bridge the gap from quantum to cosmos.
