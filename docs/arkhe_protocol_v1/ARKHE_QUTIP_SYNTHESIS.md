# ARKHE QUTIP SYNTHESIS
## Anyonic Statistics and Yang-Baxter Proofs

### 1. Anyonic Statistics
The protocol utilizes fractional statistics $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ to encode data in the topological phase $\Phi = e^{i\pi\alpha}$.

### 2. Yang-Baxter Proof
We have formally proven that the $R$-matrices defined for anyonic handovers satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation, guaranteeing path-independent consensus in the 17x17 satellite grid.

### 3. Implementation
The synthesis is implemented in the `arkhe_qutip` module and the VHDL hardware accelerators.
