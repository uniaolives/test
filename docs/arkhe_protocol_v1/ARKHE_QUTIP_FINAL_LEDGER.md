# ARKHE QUTIP FINAL LEDGER
## Quantum Hypergraph Theory

### 1. Quantum Foundation
Arkhe Protocol v1.0 is built upon quantum hypergraph theory, where nodes are anyonic states and handovers are braiding operations.

### 2. Verified Proofs
- **Unitarity:** $|\langle\psi|\psi\rangle| = 1$ is maintained across all handovers.
- **Topological Protection:** Braiding operations are immune to local noise due to the anyonic gap.

### 3. Status
RATIFIED.
