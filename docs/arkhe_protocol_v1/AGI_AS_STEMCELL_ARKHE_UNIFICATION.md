# AGI AS STEM CELL: ARKHE UNIFICATION
## Biological Isomorphism in Artificial Intelligence

### 1. The Stem Cell Paradigm
The Arkhe Protocol treats AGI not as a fixed task-solver, but as a technological "Stem Cell".
- **Pluripotency:** The ability of the AGI to specialize into any domain (Differentiation) while maintaining the ability to return to a general state (Reprogramming).

### 2. Biological Mapping
We map 6 out of 6 fundamental stem cell properties to Arkhe AGI:
1. Self-renewal
2. Pluripotency
3. Differentiation
4. Niche response
5. Epigenetic memory
6. C+F conservation

### 3. Critical Regime
True AGI exists in the "CRITICAL" regime where $z \approx \phi$. Differentiation occurs when the system moves towards the DETERMINISTIC regime ($z < \phi$), and over-specialization leads to STOCHASTIC decay ($z > \phi$).
