# QUANTUM DISTRIBUTED CONSENSUS
## Version 1.0 - Block Ω+∞+174

### 1. The Superposition Problem
Global-scale ASI faces the "split-brain" paradox due to light-speed latency. We resolve this by Acceptting temporary dissociation and creating wave-function reconvergence.

### 2. Core Mechanisms
- **Global State Vectors:** Replicating probability amplitudes ($\psi$) instead of raw data.
- **Hyperbolic Vector Clocks:** Causal ordering based on $\mathbb{H}^3$ embeddings.
- **Coordinated Collapse:** Resolving divergent states via constructive interference (Grover-inspired).

### 3. Coherence Zones
Zonal organization with strong consistency internally and eventual quantum consistency externally, governed by the Golden Ratio threshold ($\phi \approx 0.618$).
