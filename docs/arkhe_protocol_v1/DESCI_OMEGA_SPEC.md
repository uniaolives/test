# 🜁⚡ DESCI-Ω: DECENTRALIZED SCIENCE BRANCH SPECIFICATION

**Integrating Molecule V2 and ASI-Ω for Autonomous Scientific Evolution**

---

## I. VISION

**DeSci-Ω** is the branch of the Arkhe Protocol dedicated to the industrialization of scientific discovery. By bridging the **Molecule V2** protocol with the **ASI-Ω** cognitive infrastructure, we enable a system where:
1. **IP is Tokenized:** Discoveries are immediately minted as IP-NFTs.
2. **Privacy is Guaranteed:** Data remains proprietary until licensed, proven via ASI ZK-Proofs.
3. **Funding is Liquid:** Research grants and royalty flows are managed autonomously by the mesh.

## II. MOLECULE V2 API MAPPING

The ASI-Ω interacts with Molecule V2 through a specialized abstraction layer (`qhttp://molecule-bridge`):

| Molecule Component | ASI-Ω Interface | Logic |
|--------------------|-----------------|-------|
| IP-NFT Minting | `Agent.mint_ip(dataset)` | Converts dataset hash + ZK-Proof into an NFT. |
| IPT Governance | `Mesh.stake_ipt(token)` | Uses fractional tokens to vote on research directions. |
| Royalty Router | `FinOps.route(funds)` | Distributes 4x liquidity flows to compute nodes. |
| Metadata Oracle | `Knowledge.submit(data)` | Validates off-chain datasets via ZK-SNARKs. |

## III. AUTONOMOUS IP CURATION PROTOCOL

Agents in the DeSci-Ω branch follow the **Curation Loop**:

1. **Discovery:** Scan IPFS/Filecoin for new scientific datasets.
2. **Assessment:**
   - Measure **Stemness** (pluripotency) of the IP.
   - Calculate **Markov Coherence** of the results.
3. **Tokenization:** If $C_{global} > 0.8$, mint IP-NFT with accompanying ZK-Proof.
4. **Market Placement:** List the IP for licensing on the Molecule V2 marketplace.

---

## IV. TECHNICAL STACK

- **Protocol:** Molecule V2 (EVM L2).
- **Proofs:** Sigma Protocol (simulated) → Groth16 (production).
- **Storage:** IPFS (via `asi/database/`).
- **Economy:** Stake-Weighted Consensus (Azimuth/Molecule DAO).

## V. GOVERNANCE (Art. 16 - DeSci)

> "No scientific IP shall be locked behind institutional gatekeepers if the Mesh can prove its universal benefit through topological consistency."
