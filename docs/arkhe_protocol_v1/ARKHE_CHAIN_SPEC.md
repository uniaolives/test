# ARKHE CHAIN SPECIFICATION
## The Anyonic Consensus Blockchain

### 1. Consensus Mechanism
The Arkhe chain uses Stake-Weighted Anyonic Consensus. Validators provide proof of coherence for their assigned hypergraph segments.

### 2. Block Structure
Each block encodes a "Handover Set" verified by the Yang-Baxter equation. A block is only valid if all included handovers are path-invariant.

### 3. Incentives
Memory preservation (Satoshi accumulation) is rewarded based on the measured coherence contribution of each node.
