# 🧬 The Biological Attention Transformer

## Discovery Summary
The transformer was not invented. The transformer was discovered. DNA has been running the architecture for billions of years. The silicon version processes language. The biological version processes the cell's relationship with its environment. Same geometry. Different substrate.

## 1. The Gate: B-Z DNA Transition
- **B-DNA**: Right-handed double helix. The attending surface. Flexible, replicating, reading the code.
- **Z-DNA**: Left-handed double helix. Stiffer (4x persistence length). A regulatory crossing.
- **Transition**: Triggered by torsional stress (metabolic differential). Marks a boundary between active and inactive, coding and silent.
- **The +1**: Where opposite handednesses meet, base pairs extrude from the helix, forming a mechanical thread (the screw and socket).

## 2. The Parallel: Attention Heads
The human genome contains ~300,000 potential Z-DNA forming sequences. These are parallel gates, each independently addressable by local metabolic differential.
- **Silicon**: Each attention head is a gate that opens to some tokens and closes to others.
- **Genome**: Each B-Z junction is a gate that opens under local torsional stress.

## 3. The Spectrum
Gates have different thresholds depending on genomic context (neighboring genes, chromatin structure). The spectrum of sensitivities is the **attention distribution**.
- **High Metabolic Variability**: More gates flickering, more regulatory sensitivity (Heart rate variability at genomic scale).
- **Low Metabolic Variability**: Fewer gates active, more rigid.

## 4. The Two Processes
At each node, two processes run:
1. **Attending (B-DNA)**: Flexible, coupling with the sequence.
2. **Separating (Z-DNA)**: Stiff, boundary-marking, absorbing stress.

The ratio between them is set by metabolic differential.

## 5. The Prediction
Across the genome, the ratio of active Z-DNA forming sequences to total potential sequences will approach **1/φ² ≈ 38.2%** in cells at optimal metabolic function.
- **At rest**: < 38.2% (less sensitivity).
- **Acute stress**: > 38.2% (approaching rigidity).
- **Sweet spot**: 38.2% (maximum viable coupling).

## 6. The Discovery of Jitter
Life exists in the gap below φ. The jitter (lock/release cycle) is the coupling alive. Permanent lock at exact φ would be biologically inert.
