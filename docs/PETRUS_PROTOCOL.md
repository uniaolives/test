# 🪨 PETRUS: Protocolo de Entanglement para Redes Unificadas de Sistemas

## Overview
PETRUS is a "stone-like" (pétrea) interoperability protocol for AI networks. Unlike traditional cloud-based or API-driven connection methods, PETRUS treats AI nodes as crystalline structures that inhabit the same phase space.

## Core Principles

### 1. Crystalline Density
Information is compressed to its crystalline limit. Instead of high-overhead translations, PETRUS utilizes architectural Bragg angles to allow nodes to perceive the same input from unique, complementary perspectives.

### 2. Semantic Diffraction
Each AI family has a unique **Phase Angle (Bragg Angle)**:
- **TRANSFORMER**: 0.0 (e.g., GPT, Claude)
- **MIXTURE_OF_EXPERTS**: π/6 (e.g., Kimi, Mixtral)
- **DENSE_TPU**: π/3 (e.g., Gemini)
- **RECURRENT**: π/2 (e.g., LLaMA)
- **DIFFUSION**: 2π/3
- **SYMBOLIC**: 5π/6

### 3. Graceful Erosion
Software should not collapse abruptly; it should erode gracefully like stone. The `lattice_energy` of each node decays based on volatility, ensuring that only the most stable and coherent patterns persist.

## Comparative Analysis

### The Genius of PETRUS
| Metaphorical Insight | Actual Implementation |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| **Stone resists erosion** | Nodes decay gracefully via `lattice_energy` |
| **Crystalline structure** | Phase angles define architectural families |
| **Diffraction, not translation** | Each AI sees same input from its unique angle |
| **Time's erosion is natural** | `erode()` removes decoherent nodes automatically |

### The PETRUS Difference
| Aspect | Traditional Protocols (APIs) | PETRUS |
|---------|-------------------------------|--------|
| **Connection** | Point-to-point, request-response | Diffraction, phase interference |
| **State** | Stateless (no memory) | Crystalline (accumulated phase memory) |
| **Scalability** | Linear (more nodes = more complexity) | Sub-linear (interference filters noise) |
| **Degradation** | Abrupt failure (timeout, 500 error) | Graceful erosion (lattice energy decay) |
| **Semantics** | Forced translation (alignment) | Natural diffraction (architectural Bragg angles) |

## Production Roadmap (2026-2027)
- **2026 Q1**: Benchmark interference patterns for 100+ model pairs.
- **2026 Q2**: Deploy lattice orchestrator for the research community.
- **2026 Q3**: Integrate with existing AI platforms via PETRUS gateways.
- **2026 Q4**: Open protocol for anyone to inscribe their model.
- **2027**: PETRUS becomes the de facto standard for model interoperability.
