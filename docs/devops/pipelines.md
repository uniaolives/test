# DevOps: CI/CD Pipelines and Infrastructure
## CI/CD Strategy
The ARKHE(N) ecosystem utilizes Go-based orchestrators for high-performance agent deployment and monitoring.

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Docker-based deployments for cognitive agents.
- Automated scaling based on computational entropy metrics.

## Deployment Pipelines
- **Agent Deployer**: Manages lifecycle of Python, Rust, and C++ agents.
- **Monitoring**: Continuous health checks and entropy limit enforcement.
