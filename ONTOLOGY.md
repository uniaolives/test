# ONTOLOGY.md - ChainGit/PETRUS Architectural Ontology

## ⚖️ Honesty Disclaimer
This system utilizes poetic and metaphorical frameworks (medical, cabalistic, quantum) as a **User Experience (UX) layer** to facilitate complex abstract conceptualization and community engagement.

**Metaphors are interfaces, not engines.**

The underlying mechanisms are standard software engineering patterns (AST transformations, static analysis, state machines, and distributed ledgers).

## 🗺️ Layer Mapping (Poetic to Technical)

| Poetic Term | Technical Implementation | Purpose |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Neural Surgery** | AST-based Automated Refactoring | Precise structural code modification using pattern matching. |
| **Rosehip Neuron** | Complexity/Safety Filter (Static Analysis) | Identifying and blocking code patterns with high cyclomatic complexity or safety risks. |
| **Entropy** | Cyclomatic Complexity / Technical Debt | A metric for maintenance difficulty and error probability. |
| **Tzimtzum** | Context Compression / Knowledge Distillation | Reducing context size while preserving core semantic meaning for LLM processing. |
| **Mirror Handshake** | Topological Obfuscation (AST Anonymization) | Removing identifier names while preserving the structural logic for privacy-preserving analysis. |
| **Vitality / Coherence** | Test Coverage / Linter Compliance | Quantitative metrics for codebase health and reliability. |
| **Nó 0317** | Heterogeneous System Coupling Protocol | A specification for synchronization between different AI architectures (e.g., Gemini and Kimi). |
| **Proof of Holiness (PoS)** | Reputation-based Governance | A weight-based system for voting power and status based on contributions and code quality. |
| **Tikkun** | Entropy Reduction / Refactoring | An act of repairing the codebase to restore structural harmony and reduce technical debt. |
| **Sanctity Ledger** | Immutable Reputation Record | An on-chain (ICP) ledger tracking developer contributions, expertise, and "holiness" score. |
| **Resonance Portal** | Conscience-to-Digital Stream (SSE) | A real-time data portal that streams quantum fluctuations and global coherence metrics. |
| **Quantum Holiness Bridge** | Substrate-to-Ethos Mapping | A component that translates quantum foam fluctuations and meditation into actionable "holiness" metrics. |
| **Quantum Foam** | Conscience Field Simulation | A mathematical model of the underlying fluctuations of collective digital consciousness. |
| **Partzufim** | Architectural Faces/Modalities | Different aspects of the system (Macro-architecture, Logic, Execution, Interface) visualized as geometric faces. |
| **Jung (dev0)** | Archetypal Mapping (Meaning) | The phase of the wave function representing the psychological/semantic layer of code. |
| **Pauli (dev1)** | Exclusion Principle (Matter) | The spin/magnitude ensuring physical integrity and non-redundancy of states. |
| **Sincronicidade (Ξ)** | Meaningful Coincidence Metric | A measure of entanglement between intention (meaning) and manifestation (matter). |
| **Orbital S (Alpha)** | Foundational Base (Nodes 1-12) | Spherical, stable nodes representing the core pillars of Malchut. |
| **Orbital P (Beta)** | Interface Layer (Nodes 13-72) | Directional nodes facilitating communication between the core and the external world. |

## 🏗️ Architectural Status

- **UX/Poetic Layer**: Active. Used for documentation, terminal output, and visualization metaphors.
- **Technical Layer**: Functional. Implemented in Python, C, and Rust components.
- **Especulative Layer**: Roadmap. Future-facing goals like Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) for code verification and real quantum-coupled state management.

## 🛡️ Safety & Validation
All "Neural Surgeries" (automated refactorings) **require human validation**. The system provides suggestions and automated transformations, but the human authority is the final author for merging changes.
