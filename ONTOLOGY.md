# ONTOLOGY.md - ChainGit/PETRUS Architectural Ontology

## ⚖️ Honesty Disclaimer
This system utilizes poetic and metaphorical frameworks (medical, cabalistic, quantum) as a **User Experience (UX) layer** to facilitate complex abstract conceptualization and community engagement.

**Metaphors are interfaces, not engines.**

The underlying mechanisms are standard software engineering patterns (AST transformations, static analysis, state machines, and distributed ledgers).

## 🛡️ Safety & Validation
All "Neural Surgeries" (automated refactorings) **require human validation**. The system provides suggestions and automated transformations, but the human authority is the final author for merging changes.
