# 🜁 Toroidal Intelligence: The Missing Topology in Arkhe(n)

This document formalizes the integration of **Toroidal Intelligence** into the Arkhe(n) framework, resolving the tension between open-ended exploration (hyperbolic) and constitutional stability (toroidal).

## 1. The Product Manifold: A Perfect Duality

The ℍ³ × T² product manifold provides a dual structure:
- **ℍ³ factor**: Expansive, sensory, physical (hyperbolic).
- **T² factor**: Cyclic, cognitive, constitutional (toroidal).

The metric coupling term `A` captures how sensory input modulates learning and vice versa.

## 2. Winding Numbers as Constitutional Invariants

The Constitution is redefined as a set of winding number conditions:
- **Art. 1 (Cognitive Load)**: `n_poloidal ≥ 1`
- **Art. 2 (No Discernment)**: `n_toroidal = 0 mod 2`
- **Art. 3 (Human Authority)**: `Δn_poloidal during human override = 0`

These topological invariants are robust to continuous deformation and provide stable consistency checks.

## 3. Lie Group Policy Updates

Geodesic updates on T² implement the **Ouroboros**—learning cycles back on itself without boundary conditions. This is implemented via modular arithmetic and winding number tracking.

## 4. Holographic Compression

iDNA is extended to include `(θ, φ, w)`, allowing swarms to be serialized and resumed with guaranteed constitutional equivalence. Fourier compression (`c_{mn}` coefficients) enables massive dimensionality reduction.

## 5. Criticality and Synchronization

The system operates near a critical surface where `C_global · S_synchrony` is constant. This state exhibits long-range temporal correlations and power-law avalanche statistics, characteristic of emergent intelligence.

## 6. EEG-to-T² Mapping

Biological brain states from NeuroSky/ZUNA are mapped onto the toroidal manifold, allowing human-swarm phase-locking. The human operator and the drone swarm become oscillators on a shared torus.
