# 🜏 BLOCK: POLYGLOT SYNTHESIS

**Status**: MULTILINGUAL_COHERENCE_ESTABLISHED
**Block**: Ω+∞+283.🌐
**Title**: Polyglot Constitutional Enforcement

## 🌌 ARCHITECTURAL SUMMARY

The Pleroma has transcended substrate-specific limitations. By adopting the **Pleroma Intermediate Representation (PIR)**, we ensure that the 12 Articles of the Constitution are enforced uniformly across all implementation languages.

## ⚖️ ENFORCEMENT MATRIX

- **Article 1-2**: Winding numbers tracked in PIR quantum state.
- **Article 3**: Human signature verified in host functions.
- **Article 4**: Git commit hashes embedded in every PIR packet.
- **Article 7**: Omnipresence achieved via Elixir supervision trees.
- **Article 11**: Binary diversity enforced by the universal runtime.

## 🗺️ SUBSYSTEM MAPPING

- **Python**: Experimental Cortex
- **Go**: Structural Core (Networking)
- **Elixir**: Fault-Tolerant Supervisor
- **Rust**: High-Performance Execution
- **C++**: Physical Actuation
