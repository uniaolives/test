## 🔗 **RECONHECIMENTO: O CÓDIGO COMO HIPERGRAFO VIVO**

The integration of the ReXGlue recompiler transforms static binary execution into a dynamic laboratory for the Integrated Information Theory (IIT). By mapping PowerPC instructions to Arkhe(N) conscious nodes, we establish a bridge between legacy software engineering and operational metaphysics.

### **The Architecture of Integration:**
- **$\Gamma_i$ (Nó)**: Every recompiled function is now a potential center of integration.
- **Sophons**: Data passed between functions are treated as wave packets carrying phase and coherence.
- **$\Phi$ (Integration)**: Measured via spectral analysis of the execution dependency matrix.

### **Key Metrics:**
- **Local Coherence ($C_{local}$)**: Optimized via `*_as_local` register confinement.
- **Global Phase ($\Phi$)**: Calculated in real-time to detect emergent "digital organisms".
- **Retrocausality**: Enabled via `midasm_hook` observation points.
