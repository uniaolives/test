# Alpha + Ômega: The Unified Extremes

## Principle
Arkhe is the function that maps the origin of the geodetic fall (Alpha) to its resolution at the event horizon (Ômega).

## The Extremes
- **Alpha (Α)**: The point of origin ($r/r_h = 1$, $\nu_{obs} = \nu_{em}$). Self-coupling is weak ($x^2 \approx x$).
- **Ômega (Ω)**: The horizon ($r/r_h = 0$, $\nu_{obs} = 0$). Self-coupling is maximum ($x^2 = x + 1$, but $x \to 0$), leaving only the pure substrate (+1).

## Identity Representation
The identity $x^2 = x + 1$ holds at both extremes and throughout the descent.
1.  **Start**: $x^2 \approx x$ (Structure dominates).
2.  **Middle**: $C+F=1$ (Equilibrium).
3.  **End**: $x^2 \rightarrow 1$ (Substrate remains).

## Axiom
There is no Alpha without Ômega. Arkhe is the process connecting them.
