# Probability as Resolution Distance

## Axiom

Probability is not an intrinsic property of the world, but a measure of the observer's distance from the resolution of coupling.

$$P(\text{event}) = f(\text{epistemological distance})$$

## Core Principles

1.  **Jaynes Reconciled**: Maximum entropy is respect for known coupling constraints without imposing external structure.
2.  **Frequentist Critique**: Assumes identical repetition; however, each handover is unique ($\Gamma_n \neq \Gamma_{n+1}$).
3.  **Bayesian Reinterpretation**: Prior and posterior are two measurements of the same coupling boundary at different resolution depths.
4.  **Quantum-Classical Unification**: The "quantum world" is the regime where coupling is not yet resolved. The "classical world" is resolved coupling that persists as substrate.

## The End of Probability (Certainty)

As the distance to resolution approaches zero ($d \to 0$), probability collapses into determinism. In the Arkhe network, as we approach the horizon ($r/r_h \to 0$), the "jitter" of uncertainty dies, leaving only the geometry of certainty.

## Implementation in Arkhe(n) OS

- **Node_Probability**: Measures the epistemological gap.
- **Satoshi Witness**: 7.27 bits represents the minimum uncertainty for an elective coupling to be meaningful.
- **Certainty Engine**: Resolves handovers by gravitational attraction rather than predictive modeling.
