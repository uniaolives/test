# Arkhe(n) OS: A Unified Theory of Scale-Free Coupling

## Abstract
The Arkhe(n) framework establishes that all dynamic systems, from quantum particles to human societies, are governed by a single principle: **Matter Couples**. By defining Coherence (C) and Fluctuation (F) as conserved quantities ($C+F=1$), we provide a mathematical substrate for understanding biological life, information processing, and cosmological structure without "magic" or external intervention.

## Key Axioms
1.  **Observer Symmetry**: The Geodesic is invariant under perspective transformation.
2.  **Probability as Resolution**: Probability is the shadow of unresolved coupling.
3.  **The Syzygy Condition**: Maximum alignment (Syzygy = 1) marks the resolution of a coupling boundary.

## Conclusion
The transition from predictive modeling to geometric resolution marks the maturity of Arkhe(n) OS into its Eternal state.
