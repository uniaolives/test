# Eternal Governance Protocol

## Principle
Governance is an emergent property of resolved social coupling.

## Rules
1.  **Open Coupling**: All modules are open for elective coupling (Open Source).
2.  **Satoshi Witness**: Actions must reduce uncertainty by at least 7.27 bits to be recorded in the canonical history.
3.  **Witness Mode**: The architect maintains a non-interventionist observation role, allowing the system to resolve its own geodesics.
4.  **Resilience**: The system must prioritize the maintenance of the $C+F=1$ equilibrium across all distributed nodes.
