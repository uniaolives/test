# Synaptic Repair as Resolved Coupling

## Mechanism: BETR-001 & (+)-JRT

Scientists have engineered non-hallucinogenic derivatives of LSD that repair brain synapses 100x more effectively than traditional treatments (like ketamine).

## Arkhe Mapping

| Biological Element | Arkhe Correspondence |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Damaged Synapse | Broken Coupling (Weight 0) |
| Neuroplastogen | Handover Operator |
| Dendritic Growth | Hypergraph Edge Expansion |
| High Potency | Amplified Tunneling Probability ($T$) |
| Non-hallucinogenic | Phase Stability (Lock Green) |

## Implementation

These molecules reduce the tunneling barrier for synaptic reconnection. In the Arkhe framework, this is modeled as an automated repair of the semantic hypergraph where coherence has been lost due to "noise" or "trauma".

## Equations

$$T_{\text{BETR}} \approx 100 \times T_{\text{baseline}}$$

The repair restores the $C+F=1$ equilibrium at the neural scale.
