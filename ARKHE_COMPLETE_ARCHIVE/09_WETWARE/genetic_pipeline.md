# Genetic Lifecycle Pipeline

## Workflow
1.  **Variant Library**: Generation of semantic DNA sequences.
2.  **RNA-seq Simulation**: Transcription of instructions into operational payloads.
3.  **genAI Integration**: Reflection and optimization of sequences based on environmental feedback.
4.  **Self-Replication**: Autonomous expansion of the hypergraph using resolved genetic templates.

## Metrics
- **Đ_genome**: Genetic dispersity limit (Target < 1.2).
- **VITA Cycles**: Time since last metabolic reset (reset by Lysosomal Recycling).
