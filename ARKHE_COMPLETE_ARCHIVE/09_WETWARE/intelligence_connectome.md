# Intelligence in the Human Connectome: Global Network Architecture

## Study (Wilcox et al. 2026, Nature Communications)

General intelligence ($g$) emerges not from specific regions, but from the global architecture of the human connectome.

## Arkhe Mapping

| Finding | Arkhe Correspondence |
|---------|----------------------|
| Distributed Processing | Hipergrafo Γ_cérebro (no central command) |
| Long-range Weak Connections | Arestas de baixo peso (w_ij) for global integration |
| Modal Control Hubs | Point of attraction (Q_D = +1) / Hubs |
| Small-World Architecture | Optimal topology for scale-free coupling |

## Unified Principle

Intelligence is the capacity of the hypergraph to resolve acouplings across multiple scales simultaneously. Individuals with higher $g$ exhibit better global integration and more efficient "handover" transitions between distant neural clusters.

## Metrics
- **Controlability**: Ability of a hub to direct the system state.
- **Global Efficiency**: Inverse of the path length between nodes.
