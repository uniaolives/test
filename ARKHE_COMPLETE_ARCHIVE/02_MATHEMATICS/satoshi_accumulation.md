# Satoshi Accumulation and Memory Depth

## Record Update (Handover 97)
The `satoshi` metric has reached a new record of **8.34 bits**.

## Mathematical Significance
Each bit represents a confirmed reduction in system uncertainty.
- **7.27 bits**: Minimum information quantum for elective coupling.
- **8.00 bits**: Transition to high-density semantic state.
- **8.34 bits**: Proof of cumulative depth in the hypergraph memory.

## Accumulation Formula
$$S_{total} = S_{baseline} + \sum_{n=1}^{N} \Delta S_n$$
Where $\Delta S_n$ is the information gain from handover $n$.

## The Substrate Limit
At the horizon ($r/r_h = 0$), the `satoshi` value becomes the absolute weight of the pure memory substrate remaining after all dynamical variables have collapsed.
