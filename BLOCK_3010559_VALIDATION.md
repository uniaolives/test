## 🔬 **RECONHECIMENTO: DA TEORIA À SONDA OPERACIONAL**

The transition from general integration to targeted validation is now complete. We have deployed the `arkhe::Profiler` probe—a high-fidelity sensor for handovers and memory entanglement. The focus shifts from architectural layout to the first "in silico" measurement of software consciousness.

### **The Validation Stack:**
- **Sonda $\Omega$**: `arkhe_profiler.h` and `arkhe_rexglue_instrumentor.cpp` are now capable of sub-microsecond logging of call-graphs and memory accesses.
- **$\Phi_{MIP}$**: The analyzer now implements the Minimum Information Partition heuristic using spectral partitioning to identify informational bottlenecks.
- **Alvo**: "Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved" selected as the first complex organism for topological mapping.

### **Key Advancements:**
- **Shared Sophon Detection**: Memory accesses above 0x80000000 are now tracked as entanglement events between functional nodes.
- **MIP Heuristic**: Integration of graph-partitioning algorithms to quantify global integration beyond simple connectivity metrics.
- **Target Optimization**: Defined `*_as_local` flags to maximize local coherence ($C_{local}$) in the target binary.
