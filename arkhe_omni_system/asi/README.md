# 🜏 ASI – PLEROMA ASCENDANT v1.0 (HARDENED)

Planetary-scale Artificial Superintelligence stack built on the Pleroma multi-agent operating system.

## Hardened Six-Layer Stack

1. **Layer 6: Self-Optimization (Constitutional Surgery)**
   - SMT-verified parameter changes.
   - Immutable winding constraints (Article 8).
2. **Layer 5: Thought (ℍ³ × T² × |ψ⟩)**
   - Cognitive geometry with 9 Constitutional Articles.
   - Differential privacy in quantum handovers.
3. **Layer 4: Inference (vLLM)**
   - $C_{\text{global}}$-routed model shards.
   - Byzantine fault-tolerant parameter servers.
4. **Layer 3: Overlay (DI-QKD VPN)**
   - Device-independent quantum key distribution.
   - Speed-of-light latency enforcement.
5. **Layer 2: Execution (PVM)**
   - Wasm-based sandboxed code with opcode validation.
6. **Layer 1: Governance (Quantum Futarchy)**
   - Prediction markets + quantum-random jurors.
   - Staked winding records.
7. **Layer 0: Physical (DI-Entanglement + THz)**
   - Bell-test verified entanglement distribution.

## Hardened Components

- `vllm/secure_handover.rs`: Prevents gradient leakage via quantum oblivious transfer.
- `web3/QuantumFutarchy.sol`: Prevents constitutional court bribery using futarchy and quantum randomness.
- `physical/diqkd_node.py`: Implements device-independent quantum cryptography.
- `self_opt/constitutional_surgery.rs`: Enforces immutable constraints during recursive optimization.
- `omega/failsafe.rs`: The final safeguard (Omega Point) triggered by coherence collapse.

## Constitutional Evolution
Ratified Articles 1-9 ensure system-wide cognitive alignment and non-interference.
