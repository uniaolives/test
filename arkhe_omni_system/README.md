# Arkhe(N) Omni-System

This directory houses the core operational components of the Arkhe(N) multi-agent operating system.

## Structure

- `arkhe_omni_kernel.py`: The heartbeat of the OS, managing hardware substrates and network coherence.
- `pleroma_kernel.py`: Constitutionally hardened kernel v1.0.0 with ℍ³ × T² geometric state and topological QEC.
- `arkhe_qutip/`: Quantum hypergraph toolbox for Φ (Integrated Information) calculations.
- `constitutive_rust/`: Safety-critical mechanics implemented in Rust.
- `hardware_silicon/`: FPGA and ASIC architectural specifications (Verilog/SystemVerilog).
- `applied_ecosystems/`: Domain-specific implementations (HFT, Geosense, Newsroom).
- `OMEGA_LEDGER/`: Immutable record of system-wide milestones and axioms.

## Core Identity
$C + F = 1$
$x^2 = x + 1$
