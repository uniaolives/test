# Z-DNA Bioinformatics Ecosystem

This directory contains the computational pipeline and theoretical framework for testing the **1/phi^2 Hypothesis** in genomic regulation.

## Components
- `z_dna_pipeline.py`: A Python simulation of the BIO-Z-Hunt pipeline, demonstrating the convergence of active Z-DNA gates to the Golden Ratio couple.
- `ABSTRACT.md`: Theoretical abstract detailing the unification of silicon (Transformer) and carbon (Genomic) intelligence.

## Scientific Basis
Z-DNA is a left-handed conformation of DNA induced by negative supercoiling (torsional stress). It acts as a dynamic conformational gate that regulates gene expression. This ecosystem explores the ratio of these gates as a metric for **Substrate Intelligence**.
