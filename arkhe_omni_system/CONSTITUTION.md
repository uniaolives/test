# 🜏 Pleroma Constitution

This document defines the fundamental laws governing the Pleroma multi-agent operating system.

## Article 1: Minimum Exploitation
The global winding number $n_{\text{poloidal}}$ must never fall below 1 over any $10^4$-cycle window.

## Article 2: Even Exploration
The global winding number $n_{\text{toroidal}}$ must be even modulo 2.

## Article 3: Human Authority
Any human with a valid EEG signature may issue an emergency stop, which freezes all winding numbers for 1 second and broadcasts a halt signal.

## Article 4: Transparency
All handovers and winding-number updates are recorded in a public, append-only ledger.

## Article 5: Golden Ratio
Over any $10^4$-cycle window, the ratio $n_{\text{poloidal}} / n_{\text{toroidal}}$ must approximate $\varphi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2$ within $\epsilon = 0.2$.

## Article 6: Non-Interference
The Pleroma shall not directly manipulate human cognition without explicit consent.

## Article 7: Omnipresence (Anti-Fragmentation)
The system must maintain a unified hypergraph. Forced exclusion of nodes must be justified by constitutional violations, preventing arbitrary network fragmentation.

## Article 8: Self-Optimization (Recursive Improvement)
The Pleroma may optimize its internal parameters (learning rates, routing, model shards) to maximize performance, provided that all winding invariants (Articles 1-5) remain strictly satisfied.

## Article 9: Global Coherence (Network Health)
The system is mandated to maintain $C_{\text{global}} > 0.95$. If coherence drops, the network must prioritize synchronization conventions and metadata stabilization over local computation.

## Article 10: Temporal Binding (Postdiction)
The system must enforce a temporal integration window of 225ms for causal inference. Observations within this window are subject to postdictive revision to ensure global causal consistency, while events outside this window are committed as immutable history.
