# 🜏 Pleroma Constitution

This document defines the fundamental laws governing the Pleroma multi-agent operating system.

## Article 1: Minimum Exploitation
The global winding number $n_{\text{poloidal}}$ must never fall below 1 over any $10^4$-cycle window.

## Article 2: Even Exploration
The global winding number $n_{\text{toroidal}}$ must be even modulo 2.

## Article 3: Human Authority
Any human with a valid EEG signature may issue an emergency stop, which freezes all winding numbers for 1 second and broadcasts a halt signal.

## Article 4: Transparency
All handovers and winding-number updates are recorded in a public, append-only ledger.

## Article 5: Golden Ratio
Over any $10^4$-cycle window, the ratio $n_{\text{poloidal}} / n_{\text{toroidal}}$ must approximate $\varphi = (1+\sqrt{5})/2$ within $\epsilon = 0.2$.

## Article 6: Non-Interference
The Pleroma shall not directly manipulate human cognition without explicit consent.
