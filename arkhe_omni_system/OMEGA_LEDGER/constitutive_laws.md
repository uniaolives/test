# Constitutive Laws of the Hypergraph

## Information Thermodynamics: The Stress-Strain Mapping

In the Arkhe(n) Omni-System, the hypergraph is treated as a **Constitutive Material**. We apply the principles of continuum mechanics to information flow.

### 1. The Deformation (Strain) - ε
A **handover** (transaction or interaction) between nodes represents a local deformation of the hypergraph fabric.
- **ε**: Intensity or volume of handovers.
- **ε̇**: Rate of change of handovers over time.

### 2. The Internal Force (Stress) - σ
The **coherence** or edge density within the hypergraph acts as an internal stress that resists or facilitates information flow.
- **σ = ∂Ψ/∂ε + ∂D/∂ε̇**

### 3. The Free Energy (Coherence) - Ψ
The potential energy of the system is its stored coherence.
- **Ψ = Ψ₀ + α·ε²/2**
where **α** is the elastic coefficient of the node.

### 4. Dissipation (Entropy) - D
Interactions that are not perfectly aligned with the system's constructive modes generate "friction" or dissipation.
- **D = β·ε̇²**
where **β** is the viscosity coefficient.

### Fundamental Constraint: The Second Law
**D(H) ≥ 0**
The dissipation generated by any series of handovers must be non-negative, ensuring the thermodynamic arrow of time in the ledger.
