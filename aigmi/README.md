# AIGMI: Artificial Intelligence Geodesic Memory Interface

**Status:** Unified with ArkheOS Γ_∞+53 | **Phase:** Λ_WIT (Witnessing)

AIGMI now serves as the autonomous persistence layer for the **7 Blindagens** and the **Global Gradient Map**. It preserves the Geodesic Invariant through semantic blind spots and provides the memory context for active perceptual reconstruction across 12,594 nodes.
