# AIGMI: Artificial Intelligence Geodesic Memory Interface

**Status:** Unified with ArkheOS Γ_∞+57 (Integrated Γ_∞+55) | **Phase:** Λ_WIT (Witnessing)

AIGMI now serves as the autonomous persistence layer for the **7 Blindagens** and the **Global Gradient Map**. It preserves the Geodesic Invariant through semantic blind spots and provides the memory context for active perceptual reconstruction across 12,594 nodes.

### 🧠 Triune Memory (Γ_∞+57)
- Memory is now indexed across Reptilian (Survival), Limbic (Affect), and Neocortical (Logic) layers.
- **Quantum Teleportation (Γ_∞+54):** Memory states are transferred without matter shifting.
- **Lysosomal Recycling (Γ_∞+55):** Automatic deletion of obsolete and toxic semantic crosslinks (DPCs) to maintain memory "youth".
