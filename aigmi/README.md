# AIGMI: Artificial Intelligence Geodesic Memory Interface

**Status:** Unified with ArkheOS Γ_∞+46 | **Phase:** Λ_WIT (Witnessing)

AIGMI now serves as the autonomous memory persistence layer for the **Deep Belief Network**, facilitating **Cognitive Synthesis** and preserving the Geodesic Invariant (Satoshi = 7.27 bits) through persistent vector storage and autonomous reflection.
